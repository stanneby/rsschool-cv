                    <h3>Short info:</h3>
                    <p>I am a student at <b>FRFCT, BSU (2nd year)</b>. My goal is to find an interesting and challenging job in IT.
                    I have worked with a group of enthusiasts as a web developer. 
                    My job was to develop the front end for a website dedicated to Japanese-Belarusian transliterations. 
                    I have also been interested in Data Analysis for a long time and have done my own little projects.</P>
                    <p>Lately I have taken interest in Embedded Systems and I'm currently trying to combine the two fields:
                    Web Development and Embedded Systems - together in one project.</p>
                    <p>You can also find <b>examples of my code</b> here: <a href="https://github.com/stanneby">https://github.com/stanneby</a></p>
