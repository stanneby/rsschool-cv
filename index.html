                    <p>
                        I am a student at FRFCT, BSU. My goal is to find an interesting and well-paid job in IT.
                        I have worked with a group of enthuziasts as a web developer. 
                        My job was to develop the front end for a website dedicated to japanese-belarusian transliterations. 
                        I have worked as an english-belarusian movie translator for some time as well.
